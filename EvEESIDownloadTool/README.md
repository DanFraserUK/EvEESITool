To run this, copy config.txt to a folder called "DATA" where the executable is placed upon build.  Also copy scopes.dat to the folder where the executable is placed.

Go to https://developers.eveonline.com/ - log in, create a new application, name it whatever you wish.
Choose 'Authentication & API Access' add *ALL* the scopes (lol) and set the callback url to https://localhost/callback/

Confirm, then view application and you'll find the items you need to copy into config.txt.

The next update is to change all of that so anyone using this code has an easier time.
